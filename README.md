Let us learn Java Equals HashCode and try it with Data Structures
-----------------------------------------------------------------
#Test cases for Equals
	* With literals and new String() constructor
	* with same and differnt values
	* With all combinations

#Create test cases for Equals of Person
	* With correct and wrong equals and hash code implementation
	* With different data strucuture hash map,set and ArrayList

#Write test for different comparators for persons
    *name
    *name length
    *age
    *reverse

#Write test cases for ArrayList with different types
	*Do it with extends also.
